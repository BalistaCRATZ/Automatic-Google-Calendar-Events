# Automatic-Google-Calendar-Events
Updates google calendar with a set of predefined events, all given random times.

I decided to create this during the COVID-19 pandemic, as I felt everyday was the same. This code was meant as a way to automatically
generate a random timetable for the day, which would add some variation to the day.
